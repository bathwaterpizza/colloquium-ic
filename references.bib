	ABSTRACT = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are usually deployed to different areas of interest to sense phenomena, process sensed data, and take actions accordingly. The networks are integrated with many advanced technologies to be able to fulfill their tasks that is becoming more and more complicated. These networks tend to connect to multimedia networks and to process huge data over long distances. Due to the limited resources of static sensor nodes, WSNs need to cooperate with mobile robots such as unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in their developments. The mobile devices show their maneuverability, computational and energy-storage abilities to support WSNs in multimedia networks. This paper addresses a comprehensive survey of almost scenarios utilizing UAVs and UGVs with strogly emphasising on UAVs for data collection in WSNs. Either UGVs or UAVs can collect data from static sensor nodes in the monitoring fields. UAVs can either work alone to collect data or can cooperate with other UAVs to increase their coverage in their working fields. Different techniques to support the UAVs are addressed in this survey. Communication links, control algorithms, network structures and different mechanisms are provided and compared. Energy consumption or transportation cost for such scenarios are considered. Opening issues and challenges are provided and suggested for the future developments.},

	ABSTRACT = {A data frame transmitted over the underwater acoustic channel usually begins with a preamble. Therefore, underwater communication systems have a dedicated receiver that constantly listens to the preamble signals. A receiver that is to work effectively in shallow waters must have solutions that effectively reduce the impact of the permanently occurring multipath propagation. The article presents a solution based on complementary broadband signals. Initial tests were carried out using the Watermark simulator to determine its reliability in such a difficult propagation environment. The results of experimental tests carried out in a model pool are also included. Details of the implementation of the wake-up receiver are presented.},

	ABSTRACT = {Microsystems with capabilities of acoustic signal perception and recognition are widely used in unattended monitoring applications. In order to realize long-term and large-scale monitoring, microsystems with ultra-low power consumption are always required. Acoustic wake-up is one of the solutions to effectively reduce the power consumption of microsystems, especially for monitoring sparse events. This paper presents a review of acoustic wake-up technologies for microsystems. Acoustic sensing, acoustic recognition, and system working mode switching are the basis for constructing acoustic wake-up microsystems. First, state-of-the-art MEMS acoustic transducers suitable for acoustic wake-up microsystems are investigated, including MEMS microphones, MEMS hydrophones, and MEMS acoustic switches. Acoustic transducers with low power consumption, high sensitivity, low noise, and small size are attributes needed by the acoustic wake-up microsystem. Next, acoustic features and acoustic classification algorithms for target and event recognition are studied and summarized. More acoustic features and more computation are generally required to achieve better recognition performance while consuming more power. After that, four different system wake-up architectures are summarized. Acoustic wake-up microsystems with absolutely zero power consumption in sleep mode can be realized in the architecture of zero-power recognition and zero-power sleep. Applications of acoustic wake-up microsystems are then elaborated, which are closely related to scientific research and our daily life. Finally, challenges and future research directions of acoustic wake-up microsystems are elaborated. With breakthroughs in software and hardware technologies, acoustic wake-up microsystems can be deployed for ultra-long-term and ultra-large-scale use in various fields, and play important roles in the Internet of Things.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is currently used in many wireless sensor network (WSN) applications. Conventionally, the WSN’s energy consumption is considered as one of the prime concerns. The energy consumption is mostly due to the sensing, data processing, communications and other wasted energies such as idle listening, collisions and overhearing. These sensor nodes are regularly powered by an external power source and consequently have a shorter lifetime. Fortunately, different approaches for wireless energy harvesting (WEH) have been improved. Thus, wake-up radio (WuR) becomes a remedy for WEH which provides active, passive and semi-passive circuits consumption and other protocols. For instance, the most used, convincing and productive go to passive WuR which can significantly increase the network lifetime in a sensor network (SN) by decreasing unnecessary idle listening. Eventually, this paper proposes a state of the art in active, semi-passive, centering more on passive WuR and covers the applications areas. Then, an overview of WuR related to physical, medium access control (MAC) and routing layers. Lastly, the paper accentuates the potential research opportunities for wake-up technology for future IoT applications.}

	ABSTRACT = {The growing need for food worldwide requires the development of a high-performance, high-productivity, and sustainable agriculture, which implies the introduction of new technologies into monitoring activities related to control and decision-making. In this regard, this paper presents a hierarchical structure based on the collaboration between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and federated wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for crop monitoring in precision agriculture. The integration of UAVs with intelligent, ground WSNs, and IoT proved to be a robust and efficient solution for data collection, control, analysis, and decisions in such specialized applications. Key advantages lay in online data collection and relaying to a central monitoring point, while effectively managing network load and latency through optimized UAV trajectories and in situ data processing. Two important aspects of the collaboration were considered: designing the UAV trajectories for efficient data collection and implementing effective data processing algorithms (consensus and symbolic aggregate approximation) at the network level for the transmission of the relevant data. The experiments were carried out at a Romanian research institute where different crops and methods are developed. The results demonstrate that the collaborative UAV–WSN–IoT approach increases the performances in both precision agriculture and ecological agriculture.},

	abstract = {Summary Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with onboard sensors empower end-users to collect data within a wide range of civil engineering applications such as structural condition assessment. While UAVs have been used primarily as mobile sensing platforms to obtain imagery or other data, their mobility can also be used to deploy sensor networks. In this study, the feasibility of using an autonomous UAV to deploy wireless sensors in structural monitoring applications is proposed. While GPS-based waypoint navigation is available for automating UAV flight operations, this approach does not provide the accuracy necessary for the precision placement of sensor payloads on structures. Computer vision-based pose estimation is proposed to improve the accuracy of UAV localization for sensor placement. Variably sized fiducial markers integrated into a single pattern are applied to the surface of the structure and adopted as navigation and precision landing targets that identify sensor placement locations. Visual and inertial measurements are fused by means of a discrete Kalman filter to further increase the robustness of the relative position estimation algorithm that is included in the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control law used for UAV landing. Outdoor experiments under realistic operational conditions are conducted to validate the proposed vision-aided control of the UAV for sensor placement; the UAV is able to land on a predefined landing point within 10 cm. A UAV moving a wireless accelerometer to locations on a beam is used to experimentally show the validity of automating UAV sensor placement for modal analysis using reconfigurable sensor network topologies.},

However, during a flood, sensor nodes may be washed up or become faulty, which seriously affects network connectivity. To address this issue, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) could be integrated with WSN as routers or data mules to provide reliable data collection and flood prediction. In light of this, we propose a fault-tolerant multi-level framework comprised of a WSN and a UAV to monitor river levels. The framework is capable to provide seamless data collection by handling the disconnections caused by the failed nodes during a flood. Besides, an algorithm hybridized with Group Method Data Handling (GMDH) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is proposed to predict forthcoming floods in an intelligent collaborative environment. The proposed water-level prediction model is trained based on the real dataset obtained from the Selangor River in Malaysia. The performance of the work in comparison with other models has been also evaluated and numerical results based on different metrics such as coefficient of determination (), correlation coefficient (), Root Mean Square Error (), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (), and are provided.},

	ABSTRACT = {Integrated systems based on wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with electric propulsion are emerging as state-of-the-art solutions for large scale monitoring. Main advances stemming both from complex system architectures as well as powerful embedded computing and communication platforms, advanced sensing and networking protocols have been leveraged to prove the viability of this concept. The design of suitable algorithms for data processing, communication and control across previously disparate domains has thus currently become an intensive area of interdisciplinary research. The paper was focused on the collaborative aspects of UAV–WSN systems and the reference papers were analyzed from this point of view, on each functional module. The paper offers a timely review of recent advances in this area of critical interest with focus on a comparative perspective across multiple recent theoretical and applied contributions. A systematic approach is carried out in order to structure a unitary from conceptual design towards key implementation aspects. Focus areas are identified and discussed such as distributed data processing algorithms, hierarchical multi-protocol networking aspects and high level WSN–constrained UAV-control. Application references are highlighted in various domains such as environmental, agriculture, emergency situations and homeland security. Finally, a research agenda is outlined to advance the field towards tangible economic and social impact.},
